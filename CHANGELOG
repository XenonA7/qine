v0.2.0 (19-Apr-2019)
  * Theme music and battle music, courtesy of ac2pic's Custom Music
    Loader.
  * Adjusted behaviour when Qine's guard is broken - instead of an extra
    long stun, it is now a normal length stun, and Qine cannot use his
    shield for several seconds afterwards.

v0.1.3 (01-Apr-2019)
  * Qine has a new equipment set, primarily meaning he is capable of dealing
    more damage; this applies to both party Qine and PvP Qine.
  * Fixed the stun behaviour of Freezing Blow.

v0.1.2 (31-Mar-2019)
  * Qine can be guard broken.
  * Qine will more aggressively attempt a follow-up after guard countering
    the player.

v0.1.1 (30-Mar-2019)
  * Qine will refuse to fight you if you have party members (avoids a crash).
  * The stun cancel message is no longer overwritten incorrectly.

v0.1.0 (24-Mar-2019)
  * Qine now has a variety of Quadroguard-specific techs, including:
    * Neutral dash: Incite, drawing enemies' attention to Qine on a one-off
      basis;
    * Neutral throws: Ball of Shield, which hurls a shield which knocks back
      opponents, and Ball of Boom, which explodes on contact, throwing
      enemies everywhere;
    * Neutral guard: Blast Box, combining a shield with several proximity
      blasts;
    * Heat dashes: Torchbringer, which continually draws enemies' attention
      for five seconds, and Flamebringer, which also adds a trail of flame
      to hurt enemies that try to folow;
    * Cold melee: Chilling Blow, Freezing Blow, and Ice Age, which force
      enemies back and impair them for several seconds;
    * Cold throw: Final Flawke, which hurls a snowball that breaks into
      several smaller snowballs, leaving icicles everywhere;
    * Shock dashes: Charge Coil, Tesla Tower, and Gaussian Grid, which
      drop spikes that zap enemies that draw near them; and
    * Wave throws: Repel, Mass Repel, and Irresistible Force, which blast
      enemies back a considerable distance.
  * In addition, Qine can use Warp Decoy and Toxic Revenant.
  * Qine is now capable of guard countering the player.

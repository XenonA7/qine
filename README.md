# Qine

A PvP duel against Qine the Quadroguard.

This is a CCLoader mod; if you don't already have CCLoader installed, grab it from here: https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader - then unpack this into new assets/mods/ directory in your CrossCode directory.

There's currently no direct way to access the arena; to get there, you can run the following from the console:

```javascript
new frame.contentWindow.cc.ig.events.TELEPORT({"map": "mod/qine-arena"}).start()
```

If you have questions, comments, or concerns, you can reach the author, sgrunt, on Discord in the CrossCode Discord server at http://discord.gg/crosscode.
